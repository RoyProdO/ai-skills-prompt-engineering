Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As we begin the initial stages of the new WhatsApp project, I am conducting a thorough requirement analysis to ensure we align with your expectations and deliver a solution that meets all business objectives.

To proceed effectively, I would appreciate your input on a few key areas that require further clarification:

Project Scope – Could you please confirm the primary goals and expected outcomes of the WhatsApp integration?
Target Audience – Who are the intended users, and what specific use cases should we prioritize?
Functional Requirements – Are there any must-have features or workflows you envision for the platform?
Integration Needs – Will the solution need to interface with any existing systems or third-party tools?
Compliance and Security – Are there any regulatory or data protection requirements we should be aware of?
Your insights on these points will help us build a comprehensive and accurate set of requirements, ensuring a smooth development process and successful delivery.

Please let me know a convenient time if you’d prefer to discuss this in a brief call. I’m happy to accommodate your schedule.

Looking forward to your response.

Warm regards,
